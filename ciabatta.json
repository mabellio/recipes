{"name":"Ciabatta","instructions":"Make biga by adding 175g warm water, 1\/4 tsp yeast, and 225g flour into a high sided container and mixing until no dry clumps of flour remains. Let ferment at room temp for 6-24 hours. \n\nInto bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, mix your Autolyse (180g warm water and 250g flour) on low until combined. Cover with towel and let sit for 30 minutes.\n\nFor your final mix, add 40g warm water, 5g yeast, salt, and biga to your autolyse and mix on low for 3 minutes. Increase speed to high and mix for 5 more minutes until clearing the bowl and is shiny. \n\nTransfer dough to an oiled bowl. Cover and ferment at room temperature for 30 min. Do strength building folds. Cover again and let sit at room temp for another 30 minutes. Laminate dough (this takes the place of a 2nd stretch and fold). After laminating, transfer back to bowl seam side down, cover and allow to ferment at room temp for 1 hour. Dough should be gassy and alive at this point. \n\nLiberally flour work surface and dough well.  Use dough card to release dough from bowl as completely as possible before transferring dough to work surface. Gently pat into a square slab. Prepare a piece of parchment that's larger than your slab of ciabatta dough by liberally flouring it. Cut dough into two equal rectangles and gently transfer to floured parchment. Cover and proof at room temp for 30 min. \n\nPreheat oven to 500F with baking steel on the middle rack and a cast iron pan on the bottom. Boil water. Slide ciabatta onto baking steel and pour boiling water into cast iron pan in the oven. Cover loaves with turkey pan, decrease heat to 480F and bake for 12 min. Remove foil pan and continue to bake for 13-15 minutes until crust is a deep golden brown. ","ingredients":["5g + 1\/4 tsp Yeast","475g Bread Flour","10g Salt"],"modifyDate":728342465.19307}
